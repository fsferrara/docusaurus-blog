- **WebSocket Protocol**: WebSocket is a communications protocol that enables a persistent, bi-directional, full duplex TCP connection between a userâ€™s web browser and a server.
  - **Handshake Process**: The protocol initiates with a handshake request from the browser, including a Sec-WebSocket-Key, and the server responds with a Sec-Websocket-Auth hash to prevent caching proxy issues1.
  - **Persistent Connection**: Unlike standard HTTP, WebSocket allows for a binary connection that stays open, allowing both server and user to send messages at any time2.
  - **Event-Driven Web Programming**: WebSocket facilitates event-driven programming by allowing communication to be initiated from either end, contrasting with HTTP where only users request new data3.
