TLDR: _Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by examining its outputs._

Observability lets you understand a system from the outside by letting you ask questions about that system without knowing its inner workings. Furthermore, it allows you to easily troubleshoot and handle novel problems, that is, “unknown unknowns”. It also helps you answer the question “Why is this happening?”

To ask those questions about your system, your application must be properly instrumented to emit [[Telemetry Data]].
