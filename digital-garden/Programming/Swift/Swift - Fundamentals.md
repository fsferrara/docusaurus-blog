## Closures

## Optionals

## Tuples

Tuples in Swift are primarily used to group related data together into a single unit, making it convenient to work with multiple values as a whole.

let tuple: (String, Int) = ("apple", 123)

## For loops

## Array

```
var someArray: Array<Int>
```


## Dictionaries

```
var someDictionary: Dictionary<String, Int>
```

## Sets

```
var someSet: Set<Int>
```

some vs any
"some" helps the compiler to optimize since it requires the function to return always the same type.
