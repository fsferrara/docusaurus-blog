The 3 axes of an effective todo list. Using special notation in [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/), you can create a list that's sliceable by 3 key axes.

## Priority

Your todo list should be able to tell you what's the next most important thing for you to get done - either by project or by context or overall. You can optionally assign tasks a priority that'll bubble them up to the top of the list.

## Project

The only way to move a big project forward is to tackle a small subtask associated with it. Your todo.txt should be able to list out all the tasks specific to a project.

In order to move along a project like "Cleaning out the garage," my task list should give me the next logical action to take in order to move that project along. "Clean out the garage" isn't a good todo item; but "Call Goodwill to schedule pickup" in the "Clean out garage" project is.

## Context

Getting Things Done author David Allen suggests splitting up your task lists by context - ie, the place and situation where you'll work on the job. Messages that you need to send go in the @email context; calls to be made @phone, household projects @home.

That way, when you've got a few minutes in the car with your cell phone, you can easily check your @phone tasks and make a call or two while you have the opportunity.
