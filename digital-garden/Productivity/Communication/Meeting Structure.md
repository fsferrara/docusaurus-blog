It is very common in companies to have unproductive meetings.

To avoid this situation, there are guidelines we may follow. In particular, we may adopt a clear meeting structure.

There are three essential phases:

1. The beginning (the divergent zone)
    - Focus is essential at the beginning of the meeting. Be Present!
        - The facilitator ensure the meeting subject\[s] are introduced during this phase.
    - Common problem: lack of focus at the beginning
        - Solution: engage participants from the start.
2. The middle (the groan zone)
    - Do the work during this phase. It may be a simple contribution to a brainstorming or an actual task depending on the meeting scope.
    - To improve the engagement: co-create solutions and align on decisions.
    - Common problem: unstructured work phase leading to rambling discussions.
3. The end (the convergent zone)
    - Wrap It Up! Not in the sense to only wrap up the meeting room... also the meeting work needs to be wrapped and the meeting outcome should be clear.
    - Common problem: failure to wrap up, resulting in unclear outcomes and commitments.
        - Solution: Ensure clear commitments and next steps at the end.
        - If during the meeting there were planned follow-up actions, this is a good moment to recap them.

## Status Meetings - Lean Discussion Meetings

For status meetings and other meetings with a flexible agenda, this document may not fully apply. The [[Agenda for an Effective Meeting - Template]] may help for this particular case.
